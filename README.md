# Gameplay

## Flow of the game

1. The game is played in rounds, in which each player takes a turn in clockwise order, starting with the starting
   player.
1. In a co-op game, there is an Overlord turn at the beginning of each round.

## Overlord turn

1. If there was an active Overlord event card, discard it.
1. The top card of the Overlord event deck is turned face up, activating it.
1. If the Overlord has hit points between 70 and 99, the effect under the ![img.png](icons/overlord-anger.png) header is resolved.
1. If the Overlord has hit points between 40 and 69, the effect under
   the ![img.png](icons/overlord-anger.png)![img.png](icons/overlord-anger.png) header is resolved.
1. If the Overlord has hit points between 1 and 39, the effect under
   the ![img.png](icons/overlord-anger.png)![img.png](icons/overlord-anger.png)![img.png](icons/overlord-anger.png) header is resolved.
1. Some effects trigger immediately and only once, some offer conditional effects, some offer active effects until the
   beginning of the next Overlord turn.

## Player turn

1. A player turn consists of the beginning of his turn, then a main phase followed by a clean up face.
1. The main phase consists of exactly one main action and any number of minor actions, in any order.
1. The clean up phase consists of paying weight cost, resetting the journey track, resetting the attack and defense
   power of the player, and resetting minor actions.

## Beginning of turn

1. The player flips inactive pearl tokens.
1. Resolve conditional abilities that trigger at the beginning of a turn.

## Main actions

1. There are two main actions that are always available to players: journeying and resting.
1. If there is an active Overlord card in play, there is another main action available to players: challenging the
   Overlord.

## Journeying

1. Journeying means taking a card from the journey track.
1. There are six slots on the track to journey to, numbered 0 to 5, from left to right.
1. The player cannot travel to a slot that does not contain a card.
1. The cost of journeying to a slot is a number of crystals equal to the slot number.
1. If the player has the “journeys at ![img.png](icons/damage.png) 3 or more cost you only 3 ![img.png](icons/crystal.png)”
   effect, and the slot number is three or higher, this cost is set to 3.
1. This cost is lowered by the player’s speed value. If it’s less than one, the cost is zero.
1. If the player does not pay the cost, he cannot travel to this slot.

## Journey results

1. If the slot contains a creature card, combat takes place (see there). If combat fails, skip the rest of the section.
1. If the card contains an immediate effect ability, resolve it. These effects are prefixed with
   the ![img.png](icons/immediate-effect.png) icon. If the player does not own the card anymore after resolving this ability, skip
   the rest of the section.
1. If the player has effects that trigger after taking a card of this type, resolve those.
1. If that slot contains an item card, the player adds that card to his item stack.
1. If that slot contains an enchantment card, the player adds that card to his enchantment stack.
1. If that slot contains a creature card, the player adds that card to his creature stack.

## Combat

1. The player may take any minor actions he desires.
1. If the player does not have attack power equal to or greater than the health of the creature, then: combat failed.
   Discard the card on journey track slot 0. If there is an active Overlord in play, the discarded card may trigger an
   invasion. Skip the rest of this section.
1. The creature attacks the player.
1. Combat was successful, and the creature is defeated. If the player has abilities that trigger when a creature of this
   type is defeated, resolve them now.

## Resting

1. To rest, the player chooses one of the rest actions available to him. Rest actions have ![img.png](icons/rest-action.png) in
   their cost.
1. Each village card defines at least one rest action.
1. Some item, enchantment and Overlord cards also define rest actions.
1. If the rest action defines an additional cost, the player may pay it. If the player does not pay the cost, he cannot
   take that action.
1. The player resolves the effects of the rest action.
1. The player discards the card on journey track slot 0.
1. If there is an active Overlord in play, the discarded card may trigger an invasion.

## Overlord invasion

1. If there is not an active Overlord in play, skip the rest of this section.
1. This happens when a card from journey track slot 0 is discarded due to resting or failing combat.
1. Invasion abilities are defined on the Overlord card as: type: effect.
1. If the Overlord has invasion abilities associated with the type of the discarded card or any token on it, resolve the
   effects of the abilities.
1. Discard all tokens on the card.

## Challenging the Overlord

1. Challenging the Overlord means fighting him to either gain reward tokens or reduce his hit points.
1. If there is not an active Overlord in play, this action is not available.
1. Most Overlord cards define at least one challenge action. Challenge actions have ![img.png](icons/overlord.png) in their
   cost.
1. If the challenge action defines an additional cost, the player may pay it. If the player does not pay the cost, he
   cannot take this action.
1. Combat takes place. If combat fails, skip the rest of this section.
1. If you chose to play with reinforcements, add a reinforcement token with a random side up on the Overlord. If this is
   a two-player game, add another reinforcement token with a random side up on the Overlord.
1. If this is not a co-op game, the player takes one reward token from the Overlord card. The token acts as a card with
   the text that’s in the “reward” section of the Overlord card. If the reward section defines an immediate
   effect ![img.png](icons/immediate-effect.png), resolve it now.
1. If this not a co-op game and the last reward token is taken from the Overlord, he is considered defeated and inactive
   from now on.
1. If you chose to play a co-op game, resolve the effects of the “reward” section of the Overlord card. This typically
   lowers the hit points of the Overlord.
1. The player discards the top card of the adventure deck.

## Minor actions

1. Minor actions are defined as: cost ![img.png](icons/minor-action.png) effect.
1. Rest actions and challenge actions also follow this format but are not considered minor actions. They have
   either ![img.png](icons/rest-action.png) or ![img.png](icons/overlord.png) in their cost.
1. A player can activate minor actions visible on his stacks, on the village card and on the Overlord card.
1. A minor action can only be activated during a player’s turn and when preparing for a duel, and only once per turn per
   card.
1. A multi-action is a minor action in every regard, except it can be activated more than once per turn per card.
1. A double action is a minor action in every regard, except it can be activated twice per turn per card.
1. To activate a minor action, the player must pay the cost. If he does, the effect is resolved, and if it’s not a
   multi-action the effect on this card gains a used label.
1. The player may pay part or all of the crystal costs of a minor action by flipping any of his active pearl tokens.
   Each flipped pearl token is equal to paying 1 crystal.

## Paying weight cost

1. If the player journeyed this turn, discard N crystals, where N is equal to his weight value.

## Resetting the journey track

1. From left to right, move visible cards on the track to the leftmost spot that’s empty.
1. As long as there are empty spots on the track and cards in the adventure deck, draw cards from the adventure deck and
   place them left to right on the track.

## Resetting attack and defense

1. Set the player’s attack power to the sum of all visible ![img.png](icons/attack.png) icons, reduced by the sum of all
   visible ![img.png](icons/attack-down.png) icons. If the value is less than zero, the value is zero.
1. Set the player’s defense power to the sum of all visible ![img.png](icons/defense.png) icons, reduced by the sum of all
   visible ![img.png](icons/defense-down.png) icons. If the value is less than zero, the value is zero.

## Resetting minor actions

1. This means that minor actions lose the used label.

## End of the game (non-co-op)

1. The game ends after a turn when there are no more cards on the journey track nor in the adventure deck.
1. In a game where one complete kingdom deck is used per player, each player should’ve taken exactly 25 turns.
1. If you are playing with the Arena Mundi village card, each player duels the player to their left.
1. If you are playing with Sa’akara the Gamerunner, each player may duel a target player once for each reward token he
   possesses. The player may choose the same target multiple times.
1. Each player calculates how many victory points he has. The players with the highest amount wins, each other player
   loses.

## End of the game (co-op)

1. If at any point, there are more wound tokens on the wound threshold card than the limit on that card, each player
   loses the game.
1. If at any point the Overlord has zero hit points remaining, each player wins the game.
1. If there are no more cards on the journey track nor in the adventure deck, each player loses the game.

## Victory point calculation

1. Sum the victory points gained from the following sources:
1. - From the village card.
1. - From the visible sections of the cards in your stacks.
1. - From reward tokens, where each reward token counts as a card with the description that appears in the “reward”
   section of the Overlord card.
1. - From your wound count: you get -1 victory point for each wound.
1. The total number of victory points may be less than zero.
 
# Mechanics

## Adding a card to a stack

1. Adding a card to a stack means placing the card on top of the stack. If the stack was not empty, leave only the lower
   part of the previously top card visible.
1. This triggers deactivation of the upper part of the covered card – if any, and activation of the upper and lower part
   of the added card, simultaneously.

## Taking a card from a stack

1. Taking a card from a stack means taking the top card of a stack. The card that’s on top of the stack now – if any –
   is called the revealed card.
1. This triggers deactivation of the upper and lower parts of the taken card, and activation of the upper part of the
   revealed card – if any, simultaneously.

## Activating and deactivating parts of cards

1. Increase the attack power of the owner by the sum of the ![img.png](icons/attack.png) icons on the activated parts and
   the ![img.png](icons/attack-down.png) icons on the deactivated parts. Decrease the attack power of the owner by the sum of
   the ![img.png](icons/attack-down.png) icons on the activated parts and the ![img.png](icons/attack.png) icons on the
   deactivated parts. If the resulting value is less than zero, it becomes zero.
1. Increase the defense power of the owner by the sum of the ![img.png](icons/defense.png) icons on the activated parts and
   the ![img.png](icons/defense-down.png) icons on the deactivated parts. Decrease the defense power of the owner by the sum of
   the ![img.png](icons/defense-down.png) icons on the activated parts and the ![img.png](icons/defense.png) icons on the
   deactivated parts. If the resulting value is less than zero, it becomes zero.
1. If your pearl value is less than your pearl token count, discard tokens until they are equal. You choose which tokens
   to discard.
1. If you pearl value is more than your pearl token count, take pearl tokens from the supply and add them with the
   active side face up to your supply until they are equal.

## Burying the top card of a stack

1. Burying the top card of a stack means taking the top card of a stack, and placing it on the bottom of that stack,
   leaving only the lower part of this card visible. This card is called the buried card. The card that’s on top of the
   stack after the movement is called the revealed card.
1. A player cannot bury the top card of a stack if it contains less than two cards.
1. This triggers deactivation of the upper part of the buried card, and activation of the upper part of the revealed
   card, simultaneously.
1. Burying does not remove used labels on minor actions on the buried card.

## Unburying the bottom card of a stack

1. Unburying the bottom card of a stack means taking the bottom card of a stack and placing it on top of that stack.
   This card is called the unburied card. The card that was on top of the stack before the movement is called the
   covered card.
1. You cannot unbury the bottom card of a stack if it contains less than two cards.
1. This triggers deactivation of the upper part of the covered card, and activation of the upper part of the unburied
   card, simultaneously.
1. Unburying does not remove used labels on minor actions on the covered card.

## Determining health and strength

1. Monsters, dragons and Overlords have health and strength.
1. Set their health and strength equal to the values printed on their card.
1. Increase their health by a number equal to the number of ![img.png](icons/health.png) reinforcement tokens on the card.
1. Increase their strength by a number equal to the number of ![img.png](icons/strength.png) reinforcement tokens on the
   card.
1. Apply all effects that change the health or strength of monsters, dragons or Overlords when determining their values.
1. If the desert token is in play:
1. Set N to 1, then multiply it by 2 for each active effect that says “Double the effect of the Desert Token”.
1. If you have the Ignore the desert token effect, N is 0.
1. If the side with “+1![img.png](icons/health.png) -1![img.png](icons/strength.png)” is face up, increase their health by N,
   and decrease their strength by N.
1. If the side with “+1![img.png](icons/strength.png) -1![img.png](icons/health.png)” is face up, increase their strength by
   N, and decrease their health by N.
1. For both values, if the value is less than zero, set it to zero.

## Taking damage

1. Taking X damage means taking X wound tokens.
1. In co-op mode, the players have one shared wound token pool. Otherwise, each player has his own wound token pool.
1. In non-co-op mode, as long as you have ten or more wound tokens, discard ten tokens, draw two cards from the wound
   deck and add one to your wound stack. Discard the other.

## Healing damage

1. Healing X damage means discarding X wound tokens.
1. In non-co-op mode, as long as you have fewer wound tokens than the amount of damage to heal and you have cards in
   your wound stack, discard the top card of your wound stack and take ten tokens.
1. In co-op mode, you discard from the shared wound token pool. Otherwise, you discard from your own pool.
1. If you have less than X wound tokens, discard all. Otherwise, discard X wound tokens.

## Moving a card from one player to another player

1. Moving a card means taking the card from a stack of one player and adding it to the stack of another player.
1. This removes all used labels on the card.

## Discarding a card

1. You cannot discard a card from the item deck or the enchantment deck if that deck contains less than two cards.
1. If the card is an adventure deck card, put it face up on top of the graveyard.
1. If the card is a wound card, Overlord card, Overlord event card, banner card, or class card, put it face down on the
   bottom of the associated deck.
1. Whenever multiple cards are discarded at the same time, the active player or else the starting player may discard
   them in any order.

## Discarding tokens

1. Discard tokens to the supply.

## Removing a card from the game

1. Put the card back into the box. It isn’t part of the game anymore.

## Attacking

1. Attacking takes place between two units, an attacker and a defender.
1. If the attacker is a creature or Overlord, use its strength as the attack power.
1. If the defender is a creature or Overlord, use its health as the defense power.
1. If the attacker has higher attack power than the defender’s defense power, the defender takes N×F damage. N is equal
   to the attacker’s attack power minus the defender’s defense power. F is equal to 1, unless the attacker deals double
   damage, then it’s 2.

## Dueling

1. Dueling takes place between two units: players and/or an Overlord.
1. Both units may use minor actions. They get this opportunity one by one, starting with the active player, moving
   clockwise.
1. If one of the units is an Overlord, use its strength as its attack power, and its health as its defense power.
1. Each unit attacks the other unit simultaneously. Units with “when dueling you do not attack” do not attack.
1. Calculate both damage values simultaneously, before applying the damage effects simultaneously.
1. If each player must duel in a two-player game, dueling takes place twice between the two players.

## Journeying to the graveyard

1. The active player may journey to the top card in the graveyard. Resolve ## Journey results.

## The Overlord and crystals

1. If this is not a co-op game, skip this section.
1. If the active player gives crystals to the Overlord, store them on his card.
1. Whenever there are more than five crystals on the Overlord, discard 5 and add a reinforcement token, random side face
   up.
1. If a player must take crystals from the Overlord, take as many from its card as you can, then take the rest from the
   supply.

## The Overlord and cards

1. If this is not a co-op game, skip this section.
1. If a player must give one of his cards to the Overlord due to any effect that’s not part of the Overlord’s own
   abilities, he discards it instead.
1. If the Overlord must give one of his cards, or discard one of his cards, do nothing instead.
1. In both cases, if this action would be considered positive for the player or negative for the Overlord, remove one
   reinforcement token of his choice from the Overlord card. Otherwise add one reinforcement token to the Overlord card,
   with a random side up.

# Writing Reference

## Standard Terminology

-  Always write “Overlord” with a capital.
-  Whenever you are referring to a card, make sure to add “card” to the text.
E.g., you add tokens to an Overlord card, but it’s an Overlord (without card) that attacks.
-  Refer to stack and deck positions as “top” and “bottom”, and to card sections as “upper”, “lower”, “middle”, “left”
and “right”.
-  Use “each player” instead of “all players” or “every player”.
-  Use “each other player” instead of “all other players” or “every other player”.
-  Use “whenever” instead of “if” if it means “whenever”.
-  Use “whether” instead of “if” if it means “whether”.
-  The only thing you can “pay” is costs; everything else is usually “discarded”, sometimes “removed”.
E.g., you pay 2![img.png](icons/TODO) by discarding two crystals.
-  Abilities are triggered by circumstances; effects are resolved by players.
-  Put specific card names in italics.
E.g., the Cave of Fools village card.
-  Be careful to use creature, monster, and dragon correctly.
