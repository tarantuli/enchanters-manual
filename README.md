# What and Why

This is an extended manual for the boardgame Enchanters (https://mythicgames.net/enchanters-a-serial-fantasy/) by Mythic
Games.

It's a personal, non affiliated project, born from a desire to apply my technical writing itch, and this game was an
ideal target.

Enchanters, while awesome to play, frequently raises questions concerning the meaning of card texts, rules
and effect order. Even setup can take frustratingly long when trying to remember or look up the specifics of Overlords,
co-op mode, the AI deck.

This document aims to resolve these issues by providing:

- An [overview](deck-themes.md#deck-themes) of all the kingdom decks, their themes and their associated banners, classes
  and Overlords;
- A [quick setup reference](quick-setup-reference.md#quick-setup-reference1) based on the complete setup guide and
  opinionated choices;
- A [complete setup guide](complete-setup-guide.md#complete-setup-guide) containing all the nitty gritty details;
- Complete definitions of [gameplay flow](gameplay.md#flow-of-the-game) and [mechanics](mechanics.md#mechanics);
- Consistent interpretations of card texts ([costs](costs.md#costs),
  [conditions](conditions.md#conditions), [effects](effects.md#effects),
  [victory points](victory-points.md#victory-points)).

It tries to steer away from opinionated choices, to stay as close to the original texts as possible while being
consistent. Whenever possible, interpretations fitting the spirit of the game were chosen over literal, but
illogical ones. Also, we prefer simple and clean interpretations over complex ones.
