# What and why

This is an extended manual for the boardgame *Enchanters* (https://mythicgames.net/enchanters-a-serial-fantasy/) by
*Mythic Games*. It's a personal, non affiliated project, born from a desire to apply my technical writing itch, and a
desire to have a complete and consistent document that's easy to navigate.

*Enchanters* is an awesome game to play, but existing manuals frequently fail to answer questions concerning the meaning
of card texts, rules and effect order. Even setting up the game can take frustratingly long when trying to remember the
myriad ways to set up, the specifics of Overlords, the differences between non-co-op mode and co-op mode.

This document aims to resolve these issues by providing:

- An [overview](deck-themes.md#deck-themes) of all the kingdom decks, their themes and their associated banners, classes
  and Overlords;
- A [quick setup reference](quick-setup-reference.md#quick-setup-reference1) based on the complete setup guide and
  opinionated choices;
- A [complete setup guide](complete-setup-guide.md#complete-setup-guide) containing all the nitty-gritty details;
- Complete definitions of [gameplay flow](gameplay.md#flow-of-the-game) and [mechanics](mechanics.md#mechanics);
- Consistent interpretations of card texts ([costs](costs.md#costs),
  [conditions](conditions.md#conditions), [effects](effects.md#effects),
  [victory points](victory-points.md#victory-points)).

It tries to steer away from opinionated choices, to stay as close to the original texts as possible while being
consistent. Whenever possible, interpretations fitting the spirit of the game were chosen over literal ones. Also, I
prefer simple and clean interpretations over complex ones.

# Known issues

- The manual mixes usage of "you", "the player" and "the active player", probably inconsistently.
- Not all items in the keyword index link to good jumping off points.  
- Icons are represented by low quality, black on white opaque images instead of vector glyphs. 

# How to contribute

To improve both this manual and my skill, I welcome all questions and remarks. In particular, I would love to know which
text fragments are unclear or contradictory. Also, do tell me which keywords or mechanics are not explained at all.

I've used images extracted from the manual PDFs for the icons. If somebody could provide a better source, I would
greatly appreciate that. I'm also looking into creating and using a custom webfont based on the icons to seamlessly
integrate icon usage in the text.

Lastly, if you find this manual useful, please share it with friends who would appreciate it as well!
